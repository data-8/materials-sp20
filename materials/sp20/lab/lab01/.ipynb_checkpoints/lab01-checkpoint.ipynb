    "Welcome to Data 8: *Foundations of Data Science*!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weekly lab session has two components: questions and discussion (not using the computer) about recent material, and a lab assignment (like this one!) that develops skills with computational and inferential concepts. These lab assignments are a required part of the course and will be released on Monday mornings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab sessions are not webcast. The set of questions covered in lab will be posted; for the related discussion, please attend the session. There are two ways to each full credit the weekly lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Attend your own assigned lab section and make progress substantial enough for your work to be checked off by course staff. Before you leave, you need to **submit the lab and have a staff member check you off**. Even if you finish the lab notebook before your lab, **you must attend at least the discussion portion of the lab to be checked off.** Note that your submitted work need not be complete in order to receive full credit if you were checked off. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Complete the lab on your own and submit the completed lab by Wednesday morning at 8:59 a.m. If you choose this route, you must finish the entire lab and pass all autograder tests to receive credit. Because missing lab means missing group discussion of important course concepts, we recommend that you don't use this option except in weeks when you are physically unable to come to lab. If you have finished your lab early, you can still attend and participate in the discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Lab 1, however, you are **required** to attend lab and be checked off. For all other labs you can follow one of the two methods listed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely remain stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more of the [course policies](http://data8.org/sp20/policies.html) on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp20/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Today's lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, you'll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the examples in the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"

    "**167:22:06 Scott**: Well, in my left hand, I have a feather; in my right hand, a hammer. And I guess one of the reasons we got here today was because of a gentleman named Galileo, a long time ago, who made a rather significant discovery about falling objects in gravity fields. And we thought where would be a better place to confirm his findings than on the Moon. And so we thought we'd try it here for you. The feather happens to be, appropriately, a falcon feather for our Falcon. And I'll drop the two of them here and, hopefully, they'll hit the ground at the same time. \n",

    "after $t$ seconds, where $G$ is a universal constant, $M$ is the moon's mass in kilograms, and $R$ is the moon's radius in meters.  So if we know $G$, $M$, and $R$, then Newton's laws let us predict how far an object will fall over any amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify the accuracy of this law, we will calculate the difference between the predicted distance the hammer drops and the actual distance.  (If they are different, it might be because Newton's laws are wrong, or because our measurements are imprecise, or because there are other factors affecting the hammer for which we haven't accounted.)\n",
